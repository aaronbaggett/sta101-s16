# Welcome email

**Note:** Send out ~week before beginning of classes

**Subject:** Welcome to Sta 101: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference!

**Email text:** Adjust as needed. For example, no clickers for summer courses, or no note about waitlist if there isn't a waitlist for your class. Also insert due dates, links, and access code for pre-test and getting to know you survey. And, obviously, update your name at the end.

Hi class,

This email contains information on required materials for this course as well as links to resources for getting ready for the course.

Required materials:

1. Textbook: OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition
    - The textbook is freely available online at http://www.openintro.org/os. You're welcomed to read on screen or print it out.
    - If you prefer a paperback version you can buy it at the cost of printing on Amazon. Color hardcover and a black&white paperback versions are available. Links to where you can order them are also listed at http://www.openintro.org/os.
    - The textbook store will not carry copies of this text.

2. Clicker: i>clicker2 (ISBN: 978-1429280471):
    - If you would like to purchase a used clicker from a former student, see the list of students selling their clickers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkY2lFgS9uiDdE1fMkZUZnp6alJDSG9tYlIwTFJWdnc#gid=0). You can contact them directly, or leave your name on the list under "Wants to buy clicker".
    - The clickers will also be available at the Duke textbook store.
    - Or you can get them for slightly cheaper [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/I-Clicker-2-I-Clicker/dp/1429280476).
    - Note that this is i>clicker2, and not i>clicker or i>clicker+.

3. Calculator: You will be allowed to use a calculator in this class. There is no restrictions on the type of calculator. A simple calculator that can take square roots should be sufficient.

PS: A note for students on the waitlist -- classrooms are physically limited, hence I will not be able to give permission numbers to increase enrollment. You are absolutely welcomed to stay on the waitlist as I am sure there will be some students changing their schedules and some room will open up in the class. However, note that staying on the waitlist will not guarantee seats in the class due to this physical limitation.
