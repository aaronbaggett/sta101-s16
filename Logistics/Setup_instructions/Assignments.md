# Assignments (PS + Lab)

This document contains instructions for setting up Problem Sets (PS) and Labs on Sakai.

- Assignments -> Add
- Title: PS 1 or Lab 2, etc.
- Open Date: Max(Beginning of class, deadline for previous assignment)
    - Having future assignments open before the previous assignment is due results in students accidentally submitting their work under the wrong assignment and creates headaches.
- Due Date: Due date of assignment, best to set to 11:55pm of that day.
- Accept Until: 24 hours after due date (since policy says students can submit the next day for 30% penalty).
    - Important for TAs to look to see if assignment is submitted LATE so that they can apply the penalty.
- Student Submissions: Inline and Attachments
- Check the box for Allow Resubmission
    - When this box is checked further fields need to be filled
    - Number of resumbissions: Unlimited
    - Resubmission Accept Until: Accept Until date/time from above
    - Radio button for "Do not send notification..."
- Grade Scale: Points
- 100 Maximum Points
- Assignment Instructions:
    - For **Problem Sets**: (Note that if for a summer class Problem Sets are to be turned in on paper, not on Sakai, the submission instructions can be revised to just say bring your work to class at the beginning of class.)

        *See course website for assigned problems.*

        *Submission instructions: You will turn in your problem sets on Sakai. We strongly recommend working in a word processor of your choice, saving your work as PDF, and submitting that. You are welcomed to submit as Word files as well, however if we cannot open your file you will receive a 0 on the problem set (so it may not be worth taking that risk!). Alternatively you can type your answers in the text box in Sakai however if you lose internet connection and you haven’t saved you might lose your work (so if you’ll use this approach make sure to save often!).*

        *All assignments will be time stamped and late work will be penalized based on this time stamp.*

        *Late work policy:*

        - *next day: lose 30 points*
        - *later than next day: lose all points*

        *Late work policy for excused absences / STINFs: If you cannot complete an assignment on the due date due to a documented short-term illness, you have until noon the following day to complete it at no penalty. Then the regular late work policy will kick in.*

        *See course website for lab instructions.*
