""I am one of the searchers. There are, I believe, millions of us. We are not unhappy, but neither are we really content. We continue to explore life, hoping to uncover it's ultimate secret. We continue to explore ourselves, hoping to understand. We like to walk along the beach, we are drawn by the ocean, taken by it's power, it's unceasing motion, it's mystery and unspeakable beauty. We like forests and mountains, deserts and hidden rivers, and the lonely cities as well. Our sadness is as much a part of our lives as is our laughter. To share our sadness with one we love is perhaps as great a joy as we can know - unless it be to share our laughter.
We searchers are ambitious only for life itself, for everything beautiful it can provide. Most of all we love and want to be loved. We want to live in a relationship that will not impede our wandering, nor prevent our search, nor lock us in prison walls; that will take us for what little we have to give. We do not want to prove ourselves to another or compete for love. 
For wanderers, dreamers, and lovers, for lonely men and women who dare to ask of life everything good and beautiful. It is for those who are too gentle to live among wolves.""","Living with Wolves","Documentary","","","8.7","95","2005","documentary","281","2005-05-08","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473506/"

Background:

""Women and girls are the most impoverished, discriminated-against group in the world. Consider the following:

*Of the world's 1 billion poorest people, 60 percent are women and girls.
*Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, yet earn only 10 percent of the income.
*Women produce half the world's food, yet own only 1 percent of it's land.
*Women make up two-thirds of the estimated 776 million adults worldwide who cannot read or write; and girls make up 55 percent of the 75 million children not attending school.""

Margaret Mead quote: ""It has been a woman's task throughout history to go on believing in life where there was almost no hope.""

""In most societies, women face discrimination, exploitation and exclusion that limit their access to resources and assets. This disempowerment is a universal factor in extreme poverty. Rather than working with women as victims of poverty, more and more non-governmental organizations are working to empower marginalized women to challenge and change the context in which they live.""

""Tom Cappello quote: ""Film is the best way to get people emotionally connected to a cause...to get a discussion started.""

The Women:
 
""Hanh is an HIV-positive widow in Vietnam. Nada, a survivor of the Bosnian war. And Jacqueline works the slums of Bamako, Mali. 'A Powerful Noise' takes you inside the lives of these women to witness their daily challenges and significant victories over poverty and oppression.""

""Mahatma Gandhi quote: ""You may never know the results of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results.""","A Powerful Noise","Documentary","Tom Cappello","","8.0","","2008","documentary","23","2008-04","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1202574/"

Fear of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure. A most insidious form of fear is that which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as foolish, reckless, insignificant or futile the small, daily acts of courage which help to preserve man's self-respect and inherent human dignity. It is not easy for a people conditioned by fear under the iron rule of the principle that might is right to free themselves from the enervating miasma of fear.

The youth who is not sure of his or her identity shies away from interpersonal intimacy, and can become, as an adult, isolated or lacking in spontaneity, warmth or the real exchange of fellowship in relation to others; but the surer the person becomes of their self, the more intimacy is sought in the form of friendship, leadership, love and inspiration. The counterpart to intimacy is distantiation, which is the readiness to repudiate those forces and people whose essence seems dangerous to one's own.""

""Despair expresses the feeling that time is short, too short for the attempt to start a new life and to try out alternate roads to integrity. Such despair is often hidden behind a show of disgust, or a chronic contemptuousness. Integrity, therefor, implies an emotional integration which permits participation by followership as well as acceptance of the responsibility of leadership.""","Gridiron Gang","Documentary","Lee Stanley","","8.2","","1993","documentary","266","1993","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282537/"

Ensnare the love-lit hearts

You have to find a sufficient tension within a work to sustain the length of what you want to explore. But for me, it's always been about people, my fascination has always been with individual people or individual people within the group - personal actuality drama, if you will.""

""So what do you do for those people? You can try to ensure that they don't get hurt, that they get fed, that they get cared for in various ways. But respect their need for what they want. And don't get into a huge moral fuss about it. It took me years to work through all that. With 'Warrendale', for example, I learned that you could work with kids and help, particularly if they were young and had the flexibility to break through. I think people can work through problems and solve them. Emotional problems particularly. If they want to. But our tenacity is really daunting to overcome. We hold on to our neuroses with great tenacity because they are part of our very identity. The most terrifying thing of all for most people is to lose their identity. It's the hardest, most painful aspect of schizophrenia.""

""I am particularly surprised by my feelings, because I often think that I know them and then I get caught by surprise and am dumbfounded. Actually, I burst into tears very easily. But I also get angry over some things I thought I had full management over. I am always surprised by my feelings - perhaps because for many years I was a very closed person and hid my feelings even from myself.""","Warrendale","Documentary","Allan King","","7.9","100","1967","documentary","335","1967-06-07","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062474/"

I think happiness resides where we understand someone else's point of view and needs. Happiness resides where we are not lost in the solitary dream.""

'Comfortably Numb' - 'The Wall' (Pink Floyd, 1979):

""You are only coming through in waves,
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying,
When I was a child,
I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye,
I turned to look but it was gone,
I cannot put my finger on it now,
The child has grown,
The dream has gone,
And I have become
Comfortably Numb""","The Wall: Live in Berlin","Documentary","Ken O'Neill, Roger Waters","","8.7","115","1990","documentary, music","1495","1990-07-21","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244296/"
